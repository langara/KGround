# KGround

Kotlin Common Ground

Common code that should be useful for many kotlin projects.

Mainly for MPP.

Modules starting with: kgroundx have less common stuff (more opinionated / dirty / experimental).
When in doubt, try cleaner ones first: kground and kground-io.

Also now merged with kommand-line (+ kommand-samples): Kotlin DSL for popular CLI commands.
